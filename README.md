# test-code
this is a project i made for testing the linux terminal

packages needed:
python3
pip3
feh
nano

to install, first, you need python3, which usually already comes with most linux terminals
then, make the directory dummy-test:
mkdir dummy-test

then you can go to the file by typing this
cd dummy-test

then type nano dummy_test.py and paste the code
then copy the image to the dummy-test folder, and when you are done, just go to the dir and type python3 dummy_test.py

this was made using chromeos
